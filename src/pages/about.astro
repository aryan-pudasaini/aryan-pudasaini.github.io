 Hi there! My name is Aryan Pudasaini. As a medical student studying in Bangladesh, I am pursuing a career in healthcare. I'm quite interested in philosophical fiction, films, fitness, and physiology.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, I support Linux and the open-source community. Considering how monotonous medical school is, I make an effort to find time for my blog, where I write about a variety of topics that I find interesting.<br> 
<br>
I am open to fresh ideas and opinions; please feel free to contact me.
